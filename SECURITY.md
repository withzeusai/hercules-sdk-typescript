# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

This is a generated TypeScript SDK for Hercules, produced by the Scalar SDK Generator (https://scalar.com).

If the issue is in the generated SDK itself — its runtime, authentication handling, path construction, or serialization — report it to the Scalar team at support@scalar.com. We will acknowledge the report, triage it for severity and impact, and communicate a timeline for a fix or an explanation if we decline it.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please allow us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly. Do not include credentials, tokens, or private API payloads in a public issue.

## Reporting Non-SDK Security Issues

If the issue is in the Hercules API or service rather than in this SDK, report it through the security process Hercules has published.

Generated code validates emitted paths and escapes spec-derived strings, but OpenAPI documents should still be treated as untrusted input before generation.
